# 🧠 Gherkin to Playwright Automation Generator

## 📝 Project Description

**Gherkin to Playwright Automation Generator** is a local CLI tool powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that converts **Gherkin scenarios** (BDD-style) into automated test scripts using **Playwright and TypeScript**.

This project speeds up the creation of automated tests directly from written functional requirements, improving efficiency for QA teams.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This solution is designed to help QA analysts and developers:

- Generate automated tests directly from Gherkin scenarios.
- Use AI (ChatGPT) as a development assistant.
- Minimize manual scripting time.
- Strengthen the connection between functional QA and test automation.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user runs the CLI program in the terminal.
2. The tool prompts the user to input a Gherkin scenario, for example:

   ```gherkin
   Scenario: User logs in
     Given the user is on the login page
     When the user enters valid credentials
     Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
   ```

3. The tool sends this scenario to the OpenAI API (ChatGPT).
4. ChatGPT returns a block of Playwright (TypeScript) test code.
5. The generated code is saved automatically in the `output/generatedTest.ts` file.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **Node.js + TypeScript** – CLI backend.
- **Playwright** – Frontend automation framework.
- **OpenAI API (ChatGPT)** – Converts natural language to test code.
- **Cucumber Syntax (Gherkin)** – Functional test language structure.
- **dotenv** – Secure management of API keys and environment variables.
